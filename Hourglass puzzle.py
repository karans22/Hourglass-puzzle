Turn over both hour glasses at the same time and continue flipping them each
when they individually run down until the 4 hour glass is flipped {t4//4} times,
wherupon the 7 hour glass is immediately placed on its side with {t7_left} hours 
of sand in it.
You can measure 9 hours by flipping the 4 hour glass once, then
flipping the remaining sand in the 7 hour glass when the 4 hour glass ends.
